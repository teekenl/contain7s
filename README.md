## Problem
Finding the number count of given numbers that contains 7. 
For an example: 
  
  g(7)  = 1

  g(100) = 19

  g(1000) = 271

  .... so on


## How to Run
1. First clone the repo

```
  git clone git@github.com:teekenl/contain7s.git
```

2. If you have installed ruby version, please run this in terminal.

```
  ruby <REPO_DIRECTORY>/contain7s.rb
```

Note: REPO_DIRECTORY is relative path where you install/clone the repo.

3. Then, you will either see

```
Gratz!!! The contain7s method looks fine. It passed the test case.
```

The test case passed. :tada:

```
 "The result 2 is wrong given the input value: 7. Expected value: 1
 ```

 The test case failed.

4. Feel free to add more test case in `main()` method.

Note: The solution is only to able to handle positive value now.
